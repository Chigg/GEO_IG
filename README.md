# GEO_IG
IG API -> geospatial mapping

# What does it do? 
Talks to the IG API to collect information on locations determined by an initial GPS Coordinate.
Finds nearby locations and pulls recent media from their location IDs.
Collects information on the number of 'Likes' each media has with intent to generate a locational average

# Why?

Intent to map 'Likes' based on GPS coordinates to create an average across a map. Determine "like-worthy" locations
based on average number of recent media like-counts.


# What's the catch?

You're not allowed to access API data when your APP is in a sandbox.
Since this isn't a serious project, it's not worth going through Instagram's APP review.
